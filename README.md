Documentation: https://naninovel.com/guide/getting-started.html#demo-project

Naninovel package is not distributed with the project, hence compilation errors will be produced after opening it for the first time; import Naninovel from the Asset Store to resolve the issues.

Be aware, that the custom [HTML template](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/webgl-templates.html) (branded loader) bundled with the demo project is not compatible with Unity 2020 and later and will cause build issues. Remove `Assets/WebGLTemplates` and `Assets/Editor` folders and switch WebGL template under build settings to default before building the player.

If you have any questions or issues, [contact the support](https://naninovel.com/support).
